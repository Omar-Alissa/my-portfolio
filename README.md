# Omar Alissa - Frontend Portfolio

A professional portfolio project built with React and TypeScript, focusing on clean architecture.

## Overview
This project is currently in its initial setup phase. The main goal is to build a modern portfolio that showcases my projects by integrating with the GitHub API.
